1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe three or more primitive algorithms used in your day-to-day life.

    Calculating a Tip:
      1. Request the final balance/receipt from the vendor.
      2. Store the final amount in a variable called "total"
      3. IF the service of the restaurant was mediocre or bad, multiply total by 0.15 for a 15% tip rate and store as a variable, "tip".
      4. ELSE IF the service was good, multiply total by 0.20 for a 20% tip and store as a variable, "tip".
      5. ELSE if the service was amazing, multiply total by 0.25 for a 25% tip and store as a variable, "tip".
      6. Add tip and total together, giving you a new variable called "final_amount"

    Brushing Your Teeth:
      1. Retrieve toothbrush and toothpaste from bathroom cabinet.
      2. Place toothbrush bristles under running water for 2 seconds.
      3. Open toothpaste and place the desired amount on the toothbrush bristles.
      4. Place the toothbrush (bristle side) into your mouth and scrub teeth, tongue and gums for 1 minute.
      5. Rinse out mouth with water
      6. Rinse off toothbrush with running water.
      7. Return toothbrush and toothpaste to bathroom cabinet

    Doing a Push-Up
      1. Lay on your stomach
      2. Supporting your body weight with your arms, push your body to the push-up starting position. Your arms should be fully extended
      off of the ground with hands touching the ground. Your toes and hands should be the only parts of your body with contact to the ground.
      3. Lower yourself to the ground. WHILE your chest is not making contact with the floor, continue lowering yourself.
      4. WHEN your chest makes contact with the ground, push your body back to the original position.
      5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 25 repetitions.
