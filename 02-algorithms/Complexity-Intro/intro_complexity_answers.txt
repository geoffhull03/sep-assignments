1. Describe an analogy for relating an algorithm that has efficiency O(1) and
another algorithm that has O(2n).
    Answer: An efficiency of 0(1) would be like a NASCAR race car and an algorithm
    with an efficiency of 0(2n) would be a school bus.

2. In plain English, what is the best case scenario for binary search?
    Answer: The best case scenario for binary search would be that the middle point
    of the set of data would be the exact result the search was looking for. Basically, the best
    case would be one iteration through the data set.

3. In plain English, what is the worst-case scenario for binary search?
    Answer: The worst case scenario would be that the desired result is the first or last
    index of a data set. Basically, the amount of iterations would be equal to the amount of
    items in a data set, minus one.

4. In plain English, what is the bounded-case scenario for binary search?
    Answer: The bounded-case scenario for binary should would be any instance where the desired
    value was not the best or worse case scenario.

5./6. What is the limit of the function above as n approaches infinity?
    Answer: Limit == 10

7. What is the Big-O of an algorithm that has the data points above?
    Answer: O(2^n)

8. What is the Big-O of binary search?
    Answer: O(log n)

9. What is the Big-Ω of binary search?
    Answer: O(1)

10. What is the Big-Ө of binary search?
    Answer: O(n!)
