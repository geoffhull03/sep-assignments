1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
    A queue is design to be manipulated by taking the first item in, processing what it needs to do,
    and sending that item out (FIFO).

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you do that?
    Much like an array, a developer could iterate over a queue and search for whatever element they
    wanted to.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
    I think of a restaurant check-in. The first person/people to check in will likely be the first
    person/people to be seated. It is in a FIFO methodology.
