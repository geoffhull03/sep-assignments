1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
    This data structure is an stack. Although the pop, push and empty methods already exist in
    ruby, creating them from scratch allows developers to access and use these methods and
    see how they work "under the hood".

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you
search for it?
    A developer can iterate over the array/stack and search for a match for what they desire.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
    Many real-world systems use a LIFO method. One example would be a one-car garage. The car
    must leave before another can empty.
