1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
    The data structure I used, an array, has a number of methods that developers can use to access and
    manipulate the data.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you
search for it?
    They can use the search method I made as part of this assignment. Or, in general, they can
    iterate over an array and find the element they are looking for.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
    Any sort of queue or waiting list could use an array to represent an order of people or
    things in the real world.
